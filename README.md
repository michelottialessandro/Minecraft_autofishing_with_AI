# Minecraft_autofishing_with_AI


The model is able to autonomously recognize the sound of fishing and press the right mouse button to automatically fish in minecraft. Say goodbye to old fishing farms that promptly stop working when the version changes.

To increase the accuracy of the model in recognizing the fishing sound, you need to disable other sounds in the game such as background music.

To further increase the effectiveness of the model in recognizing the fishing sound, you could increase the size of the training dataset especially if you are in a noisy environment.

You might want to decrease the duration = 0.75 parameter in the auto_fishing.py file to increase the reactivity in fishing but be careful, an excessive decrease of this parameter causes a loss in the accuracy of the model.
